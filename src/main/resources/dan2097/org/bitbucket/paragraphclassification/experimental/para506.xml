<p id="p0094" num="0094" sourceFile="EP 2055703A1.xml">Colorless amorphous solid of 2-(4-methoxybenzylamino)-5-(2-methylthioethoxy)pyrimidine (172 mg) was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (3 mL) at
  <!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> room temperature, and the solution was stirred at 60°C for 2.5 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by preparative silica gel thin layer chromatography to obtain 2-amino-5-(2-methylthioethoxy)pyrimidine (34 mg, 18% for 2 steps) as colorless amorphous solid.
