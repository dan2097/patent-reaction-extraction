<p id="p0098" num="0098" sourceFile="EP 2036902A2.xml">2-Fluorobenzaldehyde (7.45g), was added to aminoacetaldehyde diethylacetal (9.16g) and the reaction heated to 100°C for 3h. After cooling, the
  <!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> mixture was transferred to a separating funnel and partitoned between diethyl ether and water. The ether layer was separated, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave an oil. Distillation at 0.6-0.8mm collecting the fraction boiling at 102-106°C afforded the title compound as a colourless oil.
