<p id="p0548" num="0548" sourceFile="EP 1670757B1.xml">A suspension of crude title compound in toluene (90 mL) at 23 °C is heated to about 70 °C with stirring under nitrogen. Upon reaching 70 °C, the heating mantle is
  <!-- EPO <DP n="179"> --> removed and the suspension is allowed to cool back to 23 °C. At about 25-26 °C, heptane (90 mL) is added dropwise with stirring at 23 °C. After 1 h, the solids are suction filtered at 23 °C and rinsed with 1:1 (v/v) toluene / heptane (20 mL), followed by pure heptane (2 x 20 mL). Suction drying affords 14.5 g of title compound as a white solid; mp 149 °C
