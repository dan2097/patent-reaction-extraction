The reaction mixture was added with water, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined, washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified
  <!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> by preparative silica gel thin layer chromatography (chloroform:methanol = 30:1) to obtain the title compound (8.4 mg, 55%) as pale yellow oil.
