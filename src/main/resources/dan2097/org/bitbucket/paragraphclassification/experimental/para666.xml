  <sub>3</sub> (8.4 mg, 0.009 mmol), xantphos (8.0 mg, 0.013 mmol), cesium carbonate (67 mg, 0.21 mmol), and 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-isoquinolinamine (22.3 mg, 0.14 mmol) in anhydrous 1,4-dioxane, that had been previously degassed with nitrogen, was heated at 100°C for 48 h . At this time, the crude reaction was adsorbed to silica gel and purified by LC (DCM to 10% MeOH/DCM) to afford the product (13 mg, 50%) as a tan solid. ESIMS (M+H)+ = 562.
