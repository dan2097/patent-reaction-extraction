<p id="p0160" num="0160" sourceFile="EP 2055696A1.xml">Compound A (203 mg; see Preparation A above) was dissolved in ethanol (3 mL) and ethanesulfonic acid (1 eq., 95%, 35 µL) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred for a few minutes, and then the solvent was evaporated. The resulting oil was slurried in 
  <i>iso</i>-octane and evaporated to dryness until a solid material was obtained. Finally, the substance was re-slurried in 
  <i>iso</i>-octane and the solvent evaporated again resulting in a white, dry, amorphous solid. The substance was vacuum dried at 40°C overnight.
