<p id="p0381" num="0381" sourceFile="EP 1326865B1.xml">To a 25 mL round bottomed flask with a stirring bar, reflux condenser and a nitrogen inlet was added 5-bromo-8-hydroxy-[1,6]naphthyridine-7-carboxylic acid methyl ester (0.511g, 1.81 mmol) dry toluene (12.5 mL) and 2-methylthiobenzylamine (0.346g, 2.26 mmol). This mixture was heated at reflux for 24h. The mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and the toluene was removed 
  <i>in vacuo.</i> The residue was triturated with a little Et
  <sub>2</sub>O/hexane, collected on a frit and dried 
  <i>in vacuo</i> to give 8-hydroxy-5-bromo-[1,6]naphthyridine-7-carboxylic acid 2-methylsulfanylbenzylamide as a crystalline solid.
