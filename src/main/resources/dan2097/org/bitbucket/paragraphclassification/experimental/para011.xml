  <!-- EPO <DP n="90"> --> 12 hours, cool and concentrate the reaction. Add saturated solution of HCl in methanol to the crude residue slowly and concentrate the solution to get the HCl salt of the corresponding amine. Triturate with diethyl ether and dry the product to provide quantitative yield of the desired product, N-2-(4-bromo-phenoxy)ethylamine, used in step C.
