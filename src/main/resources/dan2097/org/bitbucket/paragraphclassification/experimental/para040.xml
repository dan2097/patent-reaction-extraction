<p id="p0090" num="0090" sourceFile="EPÂ 2036902A2.xml">A suspension of BINAP 1.25g, 2mmol), palladium acetate (0.3g, 1.3mmol) cesium carbonate (6.6g, 0.02mol), 3-bromotoluene (4.6g, 0.027mol) and (3R)-(+)-3-(
  <i>tert</i>-butyloxycarbonylamino)pyrrolidine (2.5g, 0.013mol) in 1,4-dioxane
  <!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> (anhydrous, 50ml) was heated at reflux under an argon atmosphere for 18h. After cooling, solvent was removed under reduced pressure and residue partitioned between DCM and water. Organic phase was separated, dried over MgSO
  <sub>4</sub>, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave an oil. Chromatography on silica gel eluting with ethyl acetate and hexane (gradient elution, maxium 4%) afforded the title compound as an off-white solid.
