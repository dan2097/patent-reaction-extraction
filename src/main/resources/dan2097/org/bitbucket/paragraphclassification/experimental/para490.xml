  <b>I</b>, step A: A solution of 4-bromobenzaldehyde (100.00 g, 0.54 mol), p-toluenesulphonylacetonitrile (105.52 g, 0.54 mol), piperidine (2.70 mL, 0.027 mol), and acetic acid (9.30 mL, 0.162 mol) in toluene (1,000 mL) is heated at reflux for 1 hour, using a Dean-Stark trap to remove water. As the reaction mixture cools to room temperature, a yellow solid crashes out of solution. The solid is collected by vacuum filtration, washed with fresh toluene, and dried under vacuum filtration to afford the title compound (142.26 g, 72% yield) as a yellow solid:
