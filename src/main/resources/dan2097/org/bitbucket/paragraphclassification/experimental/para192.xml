  <i>N</i>-(2-chloro-4-pyrimidinyl)-
  <i>N</i>-(3-methyl-1
  <i>H</i>-indazol-6-yl)amine (2.8 g, .011 mol), triethylamine (1.5 mL, .011 mol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (.13 g, .11 mmol), and acetonitrile (14 mL) was added DMF (50 mL) at room temperature. Once the mixture is in solution, di-
  <i>tert</i>-butyl dicarbonate (2.36 g, .011 mol) was added portion wise over three minutes. After being stirred for 1 hour, the solution was diluted with water and extracted with ether (3X 40 mL). The combined extracts were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 9:1 CH
  <sub>2</sub>Cl
  <sub>2</sub>- EtOAc), giving 3.3 grams (85% yield) of 
  <i>tert</i>-butyl 6-[(2-chloro-4-pyrimidinyl)amino]-3-methyl-1
  <i>H</i>-indazole-1-carboxylate.
