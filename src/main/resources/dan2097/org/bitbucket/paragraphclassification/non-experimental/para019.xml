<p id="p0133" num="0133" sourceFile="EPÂ 2055698A1.xml">The deterioration acceleration testing was conducted to evaluate the light resistance of color developed upon the irradiation with light, and the degree of deterioration was measured.
  <br/> That is, the obtained sample (photochromic lens) was deteriorated for 50 hrs in an accelerated manner by using the Xenon Weather-Ometer X25 manufactured by Suga Shikenki Co. The
  <!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> color densities were evaluated before and after the deterioration. The color density (A
  <sub>0</sub>) before the testing and the color density (A
  <sub>50</sub>) after the testing were measured to calculate the degree of deterioration { (A
  <sub>0</sub> - A
  <sub>50</sub>)/A
  <sub>0</sub>} which was used as an index of light resistance of color that is developed. The lower the degree of deterioration, the higher the light resistance of color that develops.
