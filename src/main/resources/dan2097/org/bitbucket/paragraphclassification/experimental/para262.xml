Reaction was stirred for 30min and then heated at 60°C for 2h. After cooling the reaction mixture was poured into ice water slurry (100ml) and basified using solid potassium carbonate followed by extraction using DCM. Organic phase was separated, dried over MgSO
  <sub>4</sub>, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the title compound as a white solid.
