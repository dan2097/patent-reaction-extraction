The two salts are non-soluble in the epoxy and thus remain in suspension. The reactor is hermetically closed and the operation is performed using a number of vacuum and CO
  <sub>2</sub> cycles. The reactor is then connected to the CO2 line, while keeping it agitated at the given pressure and ambient temperature for the time needed.
