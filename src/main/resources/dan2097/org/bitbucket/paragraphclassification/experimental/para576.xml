<p id="p0444" num="0444" sourceFile="EP 1326865B1.xml">The enantiomers were separated by column chromatography on ChiralPak AD 50X5 eluted with 50% 0.1% DEA in hexane and 50% ethanol at 7 mL/min. Collection and concentration of appropriate fractions provided each of the enantiomers with &gt;93% ee. The faster eluting enantiomers exhibited a +0.037° rotation at 1 mg/mL in MeOH observed at 578 nm and 25 °C. The slower eluting enantiomers exhibited a -0.035° rotation under the same conditions.</p>
