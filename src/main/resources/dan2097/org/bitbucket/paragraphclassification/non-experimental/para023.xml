<p id="p0067" num="0067" sourceFile="EPÂ 1574528B1.xml">According to the present invention, there can be provided a photosensitive resin which is a material exhibiting excellent storage stability, affinity, miscibility, or solubility with respect to a variety of compounds, and high sensitivity and being solidified even under hydrous conditions as well as exhibiting high cure-related sensitivity and high flexibility and being uniformly solidified even under highly hydrous conditions, a photosensitive resin composition containing the resin, and a novel compound. When the photosensitive resin or the photosensitive resin composition of the present invention is applied to solidification of an aqueous solution, uniform gel having high strength can be formed, even the resin or the composition is used at low concentration. When applied to photo-patterning, the resin or the resin composition serves as a novel, useful water-soluble resist exhibiting high sensitivity and attaining high resolution.</p>
