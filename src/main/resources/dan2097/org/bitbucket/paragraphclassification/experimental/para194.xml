The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 2 h, and then poured onto water and extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. Trituration in ether afforded 1.87 g (90%) (2-amino-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophen-3-yl)-furan-2-yl-methanone as an orange solid. ES-MS m/e (%): 234 (M+H+, 100).</p>
