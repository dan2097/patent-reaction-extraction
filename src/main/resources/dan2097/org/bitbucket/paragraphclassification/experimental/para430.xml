<p id="p0295" num="0295" sourceFile="EP 1798223A2.xml">Dimethyl sulfate (126 mg, 1 mmol) and 4-tert-butyl-N-[4-chloro-2-(1-oxy-pyridine-4-carbonyl)-phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide (445 mg, 1 mmol) were dissolved in dry THF (5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour and at 60°C for two hours. After cooling to room temperature, to the solution was added 25% (w/v) aqueous KCN solution (5 mL) and the mixture stirred for 16 h. The solvent was evaporated 
  <i>in vacuo</i> and the product was purified by HPLC.
