  <sup>∼</sup>10 min. 2-Chloro-1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene (0.8 g, 4.56 mmol) was then added in one portion and the reaction was allowed to warm to rt. Next the reaction was diluted with EtOAc (150 mL) and water (50 mL). The organic layer was separated, washed with brine (100 mL), dried over Na
  <sub>2</sub>SO
  <sub>4</sub>, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude material was then chromatographed (EtOAc/Hexanes) to yield 0.56 g of the title compound.
