Such inhibitors include inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, geranyl-geranyl transferase, and CAAX proteases as well as anti-sense oligonucleotides, ribozymes and immunotherapy. Such inhibitors have been shown to block Ras activation in cells containing wild type mutant Ras , thereby acting as antiproliferation agents. Ras oncogene inhibition is discussed in
