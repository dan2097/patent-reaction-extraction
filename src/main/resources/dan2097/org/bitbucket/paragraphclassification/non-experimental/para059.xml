<p id="p0019" num="0019" sourceFile="EPÂ 2055708A1.xml">The blending ratio of the silicon compound represented by general formula (II) and the epoxy compound having a double bond represented by general
  <!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> formula (III) is arbitrary, and although there are no particular limitations thereon, in general, preferably 0.7 to 1.5 moles, and particularly preferably 0.9 to 1.1 moles, of the silicon compound represented by general formula (II) are blended to 1 mole of the epoxy compound having a double bond represented by general formula (II). If outside of this range, there are cases in which the reaction is economically disadvantageous since one of the raw materials is not used and remains unreacted.
