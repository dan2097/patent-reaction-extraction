<p id="p0046" num="0046" sourceFile="EPÂ 1574528B1.xml">The photosensitive resin composition of the present invention exhibits high sensitivity even when the composition has low concentration. Thus, when an low-concentration (e.g., about 0.5 to 50%, preferably 1% or more in solid content) aqueous solution of the composition is subjected to photopolymerization, a hydrogel can be formed.</p>
