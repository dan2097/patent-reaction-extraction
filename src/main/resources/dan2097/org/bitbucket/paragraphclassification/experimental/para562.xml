  <i>H</i>-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (1.0 mmol, prepared in example E-81), an aryl boronic acid (2.0 mmol, structure 7), copper(II)acetate (2.0 mmol) and triethylamine (5.0 mmol) into methylene chloride at room temperature with stirring. After 18 hours, filter the reaction mixture through celite and pour the filtrate into water. Extract the filtrate/water mixture
  <!-- EPO <DP n="117"> --> with methylene chloride. Combine the organic extracts, wash with 1N HCl, water and brine, dry over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filter, and concentrate under reduced pressure. Purify the residue by flash chromatography eluting with ethyl acetate:hexanes to provide the compound of Formula IIn.
