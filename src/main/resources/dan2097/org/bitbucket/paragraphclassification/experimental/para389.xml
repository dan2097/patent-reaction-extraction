Add THF (4.0 volumes). MeOH (1.0 volume) and 1.20 equiv. of 2N LiOH and stir the reaction mixture at RT. After stirring for 24 h no starting material remains. Add Darco (40 w%) and stir the slurry for 30 min. Then filter the reaction mixture through a plug of Hyflo Super Cel® (about ½" thick) and rinse 2 times with 1 volume of water. Filter this initial filtrate again through a Whatman® GF/F filter to collect small black particulates that escape through the first filtration. Acidify the filtrate 
  <u style="single">slowly</u> with 1 N HCl (1.5 equiv as compared to the LiOH added) {slow addition is very important for polymorph control-about 90 min. addition on 100 g scale}. Stir the milky suspension for 15 min. Filter the thick suspension through a glass frit to obtain a wet solid. Wash this wet solid 4 times with 5 volumes of water (breaking vacuum and stirring the solids with
  <!-- EPO <DP n="250"> --> the water each time). Place the wet solid in a vacuum oven at 40 °C overnight (∼15 h) to provide the title compound (92.2% yield).
