<p id="p0048" num="0048" sourceFile="EPÂ 2055703A1.xml">In the general formula (I), examples of the substituent of the aryl(lower alkyl) group which may have a substituent as R
  <sup>9</sup> and R
  <sup>10</sup> include, for example, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a halo(lower alkyl) group, a lower alkoxy group, a halo(lower alkoxy) group, cyano group and the like, and the aryl(lower alkyl) group may have 1 or
  <!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 2 of these substituents. When the aryl(lower alkyl) group has plural substituents, those substituents may be the same or different. Further, although the substitution positions of these substituents are not particularly limited, they are preferably substitute on the aryl group of the aryl(lower alkyl) group in the present invention. Examples of the group include a (C
  <sub>6</sub>-C
  <sub>10</sub> aryl)(C
  <sub>1-</sub>C
  <sub>6</sub> alkyl) group which may have a C
  <sub>1</sub>-C
  <sub>6</sub> alkoxy group as a substituent on the aryl group, and 4-methoxybenzyl group is preferred.
