<p id="p0019" num="0019" sourceFile="EPÂ 1569902B1.xml">The compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of the serine protease inhibitor PAI-1, and are therefore useful in the treatment, inhibition, prevention or prophylaxis in a mammal, preferably in a human, of those processes which involve the production and/or action of PAI-1. Thus, the compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment or prevention of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease caused by such condition, and prevention of thrombotic events associated with coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease. These compounds are also useful for inhibiting the disease process involving the thrombotic and prothrombotic states which include, but are not limited to, formation of atherosclerotic plaques, venous and arterial thrombosis, myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, coagulation syndromes, pulmonary fibrosis, cerebral thrombosis, thromboembolic complications of surgery (such as joint
