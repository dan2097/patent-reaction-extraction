  <br/> 1.0 g of 2-(4-Bromo-3-methylphenyl)-4,6-di-2-pyridinyl(1,3,5)triazine, 0.63 g of 1-naphthaleneboronic acid, 7.2 ml of a 1M potassium carbonate aqueous solution, 0.14 g of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), 24 ml
  <!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> of toluene, and 6 ml of ethanol were added and the whole was stirred for 5 hours under heating and refluxing. After cooling to room temperature, water was added thereto for washing, thereby obtaining a crude product. The resulting crude product was dissolved in chloroform and purified by column chromatography (carrier: NH silica gel, eluent: chloroform/hexane) to obtain 0.97 g (yield 88%) of white crystals of αNPy-TRZ (Compound 2). The results of NMR analysis (CDCl3) were as follows. 8.975 (2H), 8.956 (2H), 8.840-7.700 (2H), 7.973-7.890 (4H), 7.559-7.408 (8H), 2.191 (3H).
