<p id="p0066" num="0066" sourceFile="EP 1574528B1.xml">The thus-produced photosensitive resin composition was applied to the entire surface of a glass substrate by use of a blade coater, and the coated substrate was dried in a clean oven at 80°C for five minutes, followed by cooling to room temperature. The resin composition was irradiated, via a mask having a predetermined pattern, with a UV ray by means of an ultra-high-pressure mercury lamp (illuminance: 4.0 mW/cm
  <sup>2</sup>) at 500 mJ/cm
  <sup>2</sup>. The thus-irradiated resin composition was developed with ion-exchanged water for 30 seconds through the spray method, to thereby form a pattern of interest. The formed pattern had a thickness of 1.0 pm and resolution of 10 µm, and the photosensitivity of the resin composition on the
  <!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> basis of UGRA step tablet was determined to be 5.
