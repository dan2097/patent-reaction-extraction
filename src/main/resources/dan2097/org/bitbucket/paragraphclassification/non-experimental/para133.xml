<p id="p0023" num="0023" sourceFile="EP 2055698A1.xml">Though there is no particular limitation, the preferred alkoxy group has, usually, 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methoxy group, ethoxy group, propoxy group, isopropoxy group, butoxy group, s-butoxy group, t-butoxy group, pentyloxy group or neopentyloxy group.
  <br/> Among the alkoxy groups, further, there can be preferably used a substituted alkoxy group having an alkoxy group as a substituent as represented, for example, by the following general formula,
  <br/>
  <br/>         -O-R
  <sup>a</sup>-O-R
  <sup>b</sup>
  <br/>
  <br/> wherein
  <br/> R
  <sup>a</sup> is methylene group, ethylene group or propylene group, and
  <br/> R
  <sup>b</sup> is methyl group, ethyl group or propyl group.
  <br/> Methoxymethoxy group, methoxyethoxy group and ethoxyethoxy group are most desired among the above substituted alkoxy groups.
