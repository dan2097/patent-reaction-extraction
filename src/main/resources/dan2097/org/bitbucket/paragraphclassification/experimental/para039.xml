<p id="p0544" num="0544" sourceFile="EP 1670757B1.xml">A mixture of diethyl carbonate (24.1g, 0.204 mol, 2.03 eq.), ethanol (0.14g, 0.003 mol, 0.03 eq.), and MTBE (50 mL) is added to a 23 °C suspension of 60% sodium
  <!-- EPO <DP n="178"> --> hydride (8.44g, 0.211 mol, 2.1 eq.; in mineral oil) in MTBE (150 mL). This mixture is heated to about 35 °C, and a solution of 4-bromoacetophenone (20.0 g, 0.101 mol, 1 eq.) in MTBE (100 mL) is added dropwise with stirring over a period of about 1 h and 20 minutes (35 to 37 °C), followed by a about 20 mL MTBE rinse. The reaction is left to stir overnight at 36 °C, and HPLC analysis confirms consumption (&lt;1.2 area%, 218 nm) of starting 4-bromoacetophenone.
