<p id="p0562" num="0562" sourceFile="EP 1326865B1.xml">A mixture of the above propenoate (0.25 g, 0.59 mmol) in N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine (2.5 mL) was heated in a pressure tube in an oil bath at 60 °C for two days. The resultant mixture was diluted with chloroform and washed with aqueous ammonium chloride. The organic extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. Anhydrous hydrochloride was bubbled into the chloroform solution, and the resultant solution was stirred at room temperature for half an hour. The resultant mixture was concentrated under vacuum. The residual solid was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (30 mL) and treated with a mixture of 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (52 mg, 0.38 mmol), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (0.123 g, 0.64 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (added dropwise to adjust the pH to 5-6). The resultant mixture was stirred at room temp overnight and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in chloroform and washed with water. The organic extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in DMSO, and subjected to HPLC purification on C-18 stationary phase eluted with
