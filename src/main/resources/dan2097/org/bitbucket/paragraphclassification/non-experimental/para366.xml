<p id="p0036" num="0036" sourceFile="EPÂ 2055703A1.xml">In the general formula (I), examples of the halo(lower alkyl) group as R
  <sup>1</sup>, R
  <sup>2</sup>, R
  <sup>3</sup>, R
  <sup>4</sup> and R
  <sup>5</sup> include, for example, a C
  <sub>1</sub>-C
  <sub>6</sub> alkyl group substituted with 1 to 6 halogen atoms such as trifluoromethyl group and pentafluoroethyl group, a C
  <sub>1</sub>-C
  <sub>4</sub> alkyl group substituted with 1 to 6 halogen atoms is preferred, and trifluoromethyl group is particularly preferred.
