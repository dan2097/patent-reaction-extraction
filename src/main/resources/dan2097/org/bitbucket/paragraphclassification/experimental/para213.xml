<p id="p0132" num="0132" sourceFile="EPÂ 1767529B1.xml">To a mixture of 323 mg of copper (II) chloride (CuCl
  <sub>2</sub>), 309 mg of tert-butyl nitrite and 13 ml of acetonitrile was added 732 mg of 4-(4-amino-2,6-difluorophenyl)-3-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-6-methylpyridazine portion-wise under ice-cooling. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Then, the reaction mixture was poured into a mixture of ice and dilute hydrochloric acid, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed sequentially with sodium bicarbonate water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate then concentrated. The residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (elution solvent; hexane: ethyl acetate = 7:1), to obtain 0.62 g of 3-chloro-4-(4-chloro-2,6-difluorophenyl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl) -6-methylpyridazine (hereinafter, referred to as compound (xi) of the present invention).
