The compound of formula 11 can be obtained as shown below in Scheme 7 where R 3 and m are defined above for the Piperidine Compounds, R is Ar 2 or Ar 3, and P is a nitrogen protecting group. 
Si-Si bond-bearing compounds are effectively prepared by irradiating with radiation or heating Si-H group-bearing silicon compounds in organic solvents in the presence of iron complex catalysts. The Si-Si bond-bearing compounds are useful as a base material in photoresist compositions, ceramic precursor compositions, and conductive compositions.
The term "halogen" denotes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.
The deterioration acceleration testing was conducted to evaluate the light resistance of color developed upon the irradiation with light, and the degree of deterioration was measured. That is, the obtained sample (photochromic lens) was deteriorated for 50 hrs in an accelerated manner by using the Xenon Weather-Ometer X25 manufactured by Suga Shikenki Co. The color densities were evaluated before and after the deterioration. The color density (A 0) before the testing and the color density (A 50) after the testing were measured to calculate the degree of deterioration { (A 0 - A 50)/A 0} which was used as an index of light resistance of color that is developed. The lower the degree of deterioration, the higher the light resistance of color that develops.

Analogs of these compounds in which the acid group of the picolinic acid is derivatized to form a related substituent that can be transformed within plants or the environment to a acid group possess essentially the same herbicidal effect and are within the scope of the invention. Therefore, an "agriculturally acceptable derivative", when used to describe the carboxylic acid functionality at the 2-position, is defined as any salt, ester, acylhydrazide, imidate, thioimidate, amidine, amide, orthoester, acylcyanide, acyl halide, thioester, thionoester, dithiolester, nitrile or any other acid derivative well known in the art which (a) does not substantially affect the herbicidal activity of the active ingredient, i.e., the 6-(1,1-difluoroalkyl)-4-aminopicolinic acid, and (b) is or can be hydrolyzed, oxidized or metabolized in plants or soil to the picolinic acid of Formula I that, depending upon the pH, is in the dissociated or the undissociated form. The preferred agriculturally acceptable derivatives of the carboxylic acid are agriculturally acceptable salts, esters and amides. Likewise, an "agriculturally acceptable derivative", when used to describe the amine functionality at the 4-position, is defined as any salt, silylamine, phosphorylamine, phosphinimine, phosphoramidate, sulfonamide, sulfilimine, sulfoximine, aminal, hemiaminal, amide, thioamide, carbamate, thiocarbamate, amidine, urea, imine, nitro, nitroso, azide, or any other nitrogen containing derivative well known in the art which (a) does not substantially affect the herbicidal activity of the active ingredient, i.e., the 6-(1,1-difluoroalkyl)-4-aminopicolinic acid, and (b) is or can be hydrolyzed in plants or soil to a free amine of Formula II. N-Oxides which are also capable of breaking into the parent pyridine of Formula II are also covered by the scope of this invention.

1 week old wheat plants cv. Arina are treated with the formulated test-compound (0.02 % active substance) in a spray chamber. Two days after application wheat plants are inoculated by spraying a spore suspension (1 x 10 5 ureidospores/ml) on the test plants. After an incubation period of 1 day at +20°C and 95% relative atmospheric humidity (r. h.) plants are kept for 9 days at +20°C and 60% r.h. in a greenhouse. The disease incidence is assessed 10 days after inoculation. 
The reaction is carried out in the temperature range of usually 0°C to 70°C. If the reaction temperature is not higher than 0°C, progress of the reaction is extremely slow. If the reaction temperature is not lower than 70°C, amounts of by-products or degrees of coloring increase, and in addition, reaction with the ethylenically unsaturated group (addition reaction called ene-thiol reaction) is liable to occur. Therefore, such temperatures are undesirable.

It may be apparent now for the skilled person that the dose of a derivative of free IAA in the animal feed is to be adjusted in order to yield free IAA concentrations in the animal body that correspond to the ranges given herein for free IAA. This has to account for conversions that are mostly not entirely complete and losses during production when prepared chemically. Concentrations of derivatives may therefore best be established empirically, the experimental set-up as outlined in example 7 may be helpful in this respect. Consequently, when it is referred herein to a certain concentration of free IAA or a derivative thereof, it is meant that this is the concentration of free IAA or the concentration of the derivative that yields this particular concentration of free IAA in the animal. The skilled person will be aware of this and knows how to determine the proper concentrations of derivatives with the help of the teachings as provided herein.

According to the present invention, the generation of polymerized substances can be prevented at the time of storage of acrylic acid in a storage tank in a step of producing acrylic acid. When acrylic acid is filtered prior to a step of purification at the time of supply to a storage tank, the generation of polymerized substances can be prevented in the storage tank, thereby, for example, the frequency of changing filters used in filtration prior to the step of purification can be reduced. Further, the amount of polymerized substances mixed in the step of purification can be reduced, thereby the production efficiency is improved. Moreover, when acrylic acid after the step of purification is filtered at the time of supply to a storage tank, acrylic acid to be the final product can be stably stored for a long period of time. Thus, acrylic acid that rarely tends to decrease in purity and thus acrylic acid with high stability can be provided as a product by the present invention.

Organic electronic devices that emit light, such as light-emitting diodes that make up displays, are present in many different kinds of electronic equipment. In all such devices, an organic active layer is sandwiched between two electrical contact layers. At least one of the electrical contact layers is light-transmitting so that light can pass through the electrical contact layer. The organic active layer emits light through the light-transmitting electrical contact layer upon application of electricity across the electrical contact layers. It is well known to use organic electroluminescent compounds as the active component in light-emitting diodes. Simple organic molecules such as anthracene, thiadiazole derivatives, and coumarin derivatives are known to show electroluminescence. Semiconductive conjugated polymers have also been used as electroluminescent components, as has been disclosed in, for example, in US-B-5,247,190 , US-B-5,408,109 and EP-A-443 861 . Complexes of 8-hydroxyquinolate with trivalent metal ions, particularly aluminum, have been extensively used as electroluminescent components, as has been disclosed in, for example, US-A-5,552,678 . Burrows and Thompson have reported that fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium can be used as the active component in organic light-emitting devices. ( Appl. Phys. Lett. 1999, 75, 4 .) The performance is maximized when the iridium compound is present in a host conductive material. Thompson has further reported devices in which the active layer is poly(N-vinyl carbazole) doped with fac-tris[2-(4',5'-difluorophenyl)pyridine-C' 2,N]iridium(III). ( Polymer Preprints 2000, 41(1), 770 .)
