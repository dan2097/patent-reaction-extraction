<p id="p0651" num="0651" sourceFile="EP 1326865B1.xml">Methyl 8-hydroxy-1,6-naphthyridine-7-carboxylate (10.0 grams, 48.9 mmol) prepared as described in Example 1 was dissolved/suspended in MeOH (100 mL) and treated with 4-fluorobenzylamine (6.1g, 48.9 mmol). The reaction was brought to reflux and the MeOH allowed to evaporate until the total volume was approximately 30 mL. The reaction was refluxed for 5 hours more and a white solid
  <!-- EPO <DP n="347"> --> precipitated. The reaction was cooled and the solid collected by filtration, washed with a minimum of MeOH and dried on the pump to give the product as a white solid.
