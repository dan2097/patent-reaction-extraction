The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature. The crude reaction was diluted with water (10 mL) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2x10 mL). The organic phase was dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated 
  <i>in vacuo</i> to afford a yellow oily solid. The material was suspended in methanol and a yellow precipitate fell out of solution. Washing with fresh methanol (2 x 10 mL) gave the desired product as an off-white solid.
