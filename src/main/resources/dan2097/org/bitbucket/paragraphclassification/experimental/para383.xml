<p id="p0404" num="0404" sourceFile="EP 2055705A1.xml">Under an argon atmosphere, trifluoroacetic acid (20 mL) was added to the compound (5.48 g) synthesized in Example 19, followed by stirring at 60°C for 2 hours. The reaction solution was concentrated and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (manufactured by FUJI SILYSIA CHEMICAL LTD., CHROMATOREX NH (trade name)) (n-hexane : ethyl acetate = 4 : 1 → 1 : 1 → 0 : 1 → ethyl acetate : methanol = 100 : 0 → 80 : 20) to obtain the title compound (3.18 g) having the following physical properties.
  <br/> TLC: Rf 0.40 (dichloromethane : methanol : 28% ammonia water = 80 : 20 : 2);
  <br/> NMR(CDCl
  <sub>3</sub>): δ 1.60-2.00(m, 8H), 2.38-2.55(m, 4H), 2.62-2.76(m, 2H), 3.00-3.20(m, 4H), 3.60(s, 2H), 3.62-3.74(m, 7H), 3.90(t, J = 5.7Hz, 2H), 4.03(s, 2H), 6.92(d, J = 1.5Hz, 1H),
