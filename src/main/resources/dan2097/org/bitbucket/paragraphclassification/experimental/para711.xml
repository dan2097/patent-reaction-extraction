<p id="p0585" num="0585" sourceFile="EP 1326865B1.xml">A solution of the above acetylpyrazolidine (50 mg, Step 1), water (0.25 mL), and TFA (0.15 mL) in acetonitrile (5 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours. The resultant mixture was concentrated under vacuum. Residual water and TFA was removed by co-evaporation with additional acetonitrile (3 x 5 mL). Without further pruification, the residual oil was treated with 4-fluorobenzylamine (0.2 mL) in a mixture of methanol (1 mL) and toluene (8 mL) in a sealed tube was heated in an oil bath at 120 °C for 2 hours. The product mixture was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in DMSO, and subjected to HPLC purification on C-18 stationary phase eluted with water/acetonitrile/TFA mobile phase. Collection and lyophilization of appropriate fractions provided the title compound.
