<p id="p0102" num="0102" sourceFile="EP 1670757B1.xml">A solution of 2-iodo-3-methylthiothiophene (18 g, 70.3 mmol, preparation 2), 4-bromobenzeneboronic acid (14.1 g, 70.3 mmol), potassium carbonate (21.4 g, 155 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium (0) (8.1 g, 7.02 mmol) in a mixture of anhydrous dimethoxyethane (300 ml) and absolute ethanol (150 ml) is degassed with Ar or N
  <sub>2</sub> for 15 min and stirred for 12 hours at 80°C. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, water (100 ml) is then added and the crude product is extracted with methylene chloride (3 x 150ml). The crude product is purified by column chromatography using hexane as eluent solvent yielding 12 g (60 %) of title compound as a white solid. NOTE: This product is also light sensitive and should be used immediately.
