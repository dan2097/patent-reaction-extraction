<p id="p0168" num="0168" sourceFile="EPÂ 1778400B1.xml">A solution of 0.124 g (0.4 mmol) of 3,4,5-trimethyl-1-(8-quinolyl)-2-trimethylsilylcyclopentadiene in 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added to a suspension of 0.016 g (0.4 mmol) of potassium hydride in 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours and subsequently added to a solution of 0.15 g (0.4 mmol) of chromium trichloride tris(tetrahydrofuran) in 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran while stirring. The mixture was stirred for a further 12 hours at room temperature, and the solvent was then distilled off and the residue was washed 3 times with hexane. The soluble components of the residue obtained in this way were taken up in hot toluene and filtered. The filtrate was freed of solvent, washed and dried under reduced pressure. This gave 0.11 g (0.26 mmol) of (3,4,5-trimethyl-1-(8-quinolyl)-2-trimethylsilylcyclopentadienyl)chromium dichloride (65%).
