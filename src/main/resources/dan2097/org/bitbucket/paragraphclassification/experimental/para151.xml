<p id="p0087" num="0087" sourceFile="EP 1670757B1.xml">In Scheme XXI, Step B, the compound of structure (17) is converted to the compound of Formula IIz under standard conditions. For example, the compound of structure (17) is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, such as THF and cooled to about -70°C. The solution is then treated with about 0.9 equivalents of a suitable base, such as n-butyllithium and then stirred for about 0.5 to 1 hour at -70°C. To this solution is then added about 3 equivalents of a suitable chloroformate, such as ethyl chloroformate and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over about one hour. The
  <!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> reaction is then quenched with saturated ammonium chloride and extracted with a suitable organic solvent, such as ethyl acetate. The organic extracts are combined, washed with water, brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product can then be purified by chromatography on silica gel with a suitable eluent, such as toluene:ethyl acetate to provide the purified compound of Formula IIz.
