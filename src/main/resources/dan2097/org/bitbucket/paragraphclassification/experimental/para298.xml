The sample is heated to about 60 °C with stirring in 2mL of acetone. With a suspension present, a 1 molar equivalence of diethanolamine in 1mL of metanol is added. Immediately the batch becomes clear. The clear solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. After overnight stirring, the suspension is then isolated by vacuum filtration and the solid is allowed to air dry to provide the title compound.</p>
