<p id="p0006" num="0006" sourceFile="EPÂ 1574528A1.xml">The photosensitive resin and the composition thereof disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (
  <i>kokai</i>) No. 2000-181062 are remarkably excellent materials as a photoresist, of which aqueous solution is applied to a substrate, dried, patternwise exposed, and developed. However, phototosensitivity of the materials is insufficient for use as a photosensitive gel-forming agent that forms gel through photocuring under water-rich conditions. Thus, a photosensitive resin and a photosensitive resin composition exhibiting higher sensitivity have been keenly demanded.
