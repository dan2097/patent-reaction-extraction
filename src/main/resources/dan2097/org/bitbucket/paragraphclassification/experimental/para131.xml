  </b> 1.597 g, 3.250 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (3.25 mL) at 40 °C and transferred to a solution of 0.5M NaOMe in MeOH (16.25 mL, 8.125 mmol) over ca 1-2 min at 20-25 °C. The resulting yellow homogenous mixture was heated to 50 °C and aged for 5 min (HPLC analysis indicated &lt;0.5% starting material remaining). Mixture was cooled to 25 °C over 15 min and aged at 25 °C for 15 min during which a yellow crystalline precipitate was deposited. Acetic acid (390 mg, 6.50 mmol) was added over 1 min (yellow color faded) then water (32.5 mL) was added over 15 min at 25 °C. The slurry was aged for 30 min 25 °C and filtered. The filter cake was washed with 1:1 MeOH:water (32.5 mL) and then with 1:1 MTBE:hexanes (8 mL). The filter cake was dried under a stream of nitrogen to provide 1.064 g (97%) of 5-(
