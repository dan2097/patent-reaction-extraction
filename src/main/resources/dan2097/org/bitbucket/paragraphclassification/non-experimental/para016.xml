<p id="pa01" num="0001" sourceFile="EPÂ 2055707A1.xml">Si-Si bond-bearing compounds are effectively prepared by irradiating with radiation or heating Si-H group-bearing silicon compounds in organic solvents in the presence of iron complex catalysts. The Si-Si bond-bearing compounds are useful as a base material in photoresist compositions, ceramic precursor compositions, and conductive compositions.</p>
