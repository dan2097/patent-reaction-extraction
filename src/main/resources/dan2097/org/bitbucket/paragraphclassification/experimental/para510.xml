  <i>N</i>-(3-{3-[2-(2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxin-6-ylamino)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl}-phenyl)-benzamide (43 mg, 0.08 mmol) and and excess of Lawesson's Reagent in 1,4-dioxane (1 mL) was heated at 100 °C in a sealed tube. When LC/MS showed the starting material to be consumed, the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and diluted with DCM. The organic phase was washed with water, dried over MgSO
  <sub>4</sub> and concentrated. The crude material was purified through silica gel to give the title compound as a yellow solid.
