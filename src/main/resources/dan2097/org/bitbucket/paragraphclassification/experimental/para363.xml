The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, further added with boron tribromide (1.0 mol/L solution in dichloromethane, 450 µL, 0.45 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 50°C for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was added with water, and extracted with chloroform. The organic layers were combined, washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by preparative silica gel thin layer chromatography (chloroform:methanol =20:1) to obtain the title compound (3.1 mg, 18 %) as green oil.</p>
