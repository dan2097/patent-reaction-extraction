<p id="p0204" num="0204" sourceFile="EP 2045806A2.xml">51.79g of acetyl acetic acid ethylester were dissolved in ethanol (160ml) at room temperature under nitrogen. The solution was cooled to 0°C and 27.08g of sodium ethylate were added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min. and 48.57g of 2-cyano-N-prop-2-inyl-acetamide were added portionwise. The suspension was refluxed for 15 hours while ethanol was exchanged three times to remove the water formed during the reaction. After being cooled to room temperature, the mixture was dilute with ethanol, the solid was filtered and dried in vacuum at 80 °C to afford compound of formula (c2).
