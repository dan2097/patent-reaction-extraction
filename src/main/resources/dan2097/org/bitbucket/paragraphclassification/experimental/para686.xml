To this was added 220 µL of 100mM GSH aqueous solution, stirred for 30 seconds with Voltex, and then allowed at 37°C for 30 minutes. To this was added 20 µL of
  <!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> 100ppm inorganic arsenic (III) standard solution (for the atomic absorption) and stirred for 30 seconds. To this was added 20 µL of 7.4mM methylcobalamin (MeCo) aqueous solution (composition A). This was reacted in a constant temperature bath maintained at 37°C, the increasing amount of the product obtained with sampling at regular intervals was examined.
