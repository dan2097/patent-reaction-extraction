<p id="p0363" num="0363" sourceFile="EP 2055705A1.xml">To an N-methylpyrrolidone (25 mL) solution of 1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde (2.0 g), potassium carbonate (2.9 g) and ethyl chloroacetate (6.7 mL) were added. The resultant solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours. To the reaction solution, water (50 mL) was added. The aqueous layer was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined, washed with saturated brine and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The anhydrous sodium sulfate was removed by filtration and then the organic solvent was conentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (n-hexane : ethyl acetate = 60 : 40 → 0 : 100) to obtain the title compound having the following physical properties (2.9 g).
