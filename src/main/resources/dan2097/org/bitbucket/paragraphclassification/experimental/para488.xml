  <i>N</i>-{5-[(2-chloro-4-pyrimidinyl)ethynyl]-2-fluorophenyl}-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide (4.6 g, 13 mmol) in DMF (100 mL) was added aminopyridinium iodide (5.9 g, 27 mmol) and potassium carbonate (5.5 g, 40 mmol). After stirring 2 h at rt, the reaction mixture was diluted with diethyl ether (250 mL) and EtOAc (250 mL), and washed with water. The organic layer was adsorbed to silica gel and purified by column chromatography to afford the desired product (3.2 g, 55%) as a tan solid.
