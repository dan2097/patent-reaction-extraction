Ammonium chloride (48.4 g, 0.91 mol) in water (100 ml) was added drop wise and the reaction mixture refluxed for 5 hr. The reaction mixture was filtered over Celite and washed with methanol. Methanol was removed, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethylacetate, washed with brine, dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated to yield 1,2-difluoro-4-aminobenzene (7 g, 43%).</p>
