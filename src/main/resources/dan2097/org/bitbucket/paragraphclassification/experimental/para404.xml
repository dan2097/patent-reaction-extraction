<p id="p0166" num="0166" sourceFile="EP 2055696A1.xml">Compound A (20.0 g; see Preparation A above) was dissolved in 
  <i>iso</i>-propanol (146.6 mL) at 40°C and ethanesulfonic acid (3.46 mL, 95%, 1 eq.) was added to the solution. To the resulting clear solution, seed crystals of Compound A, ethanesulfonic acid salt were added (50 mg; see Examples 4 to 8 above). Then, ethyl acetate (234 mL) was added over 10 minutes. The resulting slightly opaque solution was seeded once more (70 mg) and left for one hour at 40°C with stirring to allow for crystallization to start. After this, a total of 352 mL of ethyl acetate was added at a constant rate over one hour. When all of the ethyl acetate had been added, the slurry was left for 1 hour, before being cooled to 21°C over 2 hours. The crystallization was allowed to continue for 1 hour at 21 °C before the crystals were filtered off, washed twice with ethyl acetate (50 mL + 60 mL) and finally, dried under reduced pressure at 40°C overnight. A total of 21.6 g of a white, crystalline salt was obtained, corresponding to a yield of approximately 90%.
