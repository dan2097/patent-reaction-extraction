Alternatively the title compound may be prepared by the following procedure. Charge the 3-amino-4-cyano-5-ethyl-1-methyl-1 H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester prepared in preparation 37, diiodomethane, and acetonitrile to a 22L round-bottom flask equipped with an addition funnel, thermocouple, overhead stirrer, and condenser. Dilute isoamyl nitrite with heptane and charge the resulting solution to the addition funnel. Warm the reaction mixture to 78 °C. Add 0.65 L of the isoamyl nitrite solution over 1.75 hours, at which point vigorous evolution of nitrogen is observed. Suspend the addition of the isoamyl nitrite solution for about 20 minutes to allow the off-gassing to subside. Add the remainder of the isoamyl nitrite solution over 15 minutes. Stir the reaction mixture at reflux for an additional 2 hours, then cool to room temperature. Remove the solvent under reduced pressure and dilute the resulting concentrate with a mixture of 0.2 L pentane and 0.2 L methylene chloride. Pour the resulting mixture onto a 4 kg column of silica gel that is pre-wetted with cyclohexane. Elute the column with 5 gallons of cyclohexane, and discard the eluent. Next, elute the column with 6 gallons of a 1:1 mixture of cyclohexane: methylene chloride, followed by 5 gallons of 3:2 cyclohexane:methylene chloride. Combine these fractions and remove the solvent under reduced pressure. Suspend the resulting solid in 0.5 L of heptane and stir for 45 minutes. Collect the product by filtration, rinse with heptane, and vacuum-dry at 40 °C to afford the title compound (432.8 g) in 57.6% yield. Mass spectrum (m/e): 333.0 (M+1).

MeOH (1.0 volume) and 1.20 equiv. of 2N LiOH and stir the reaction mixture at RT. After stirring for 24 h no starting material remains. Add Darco (40 w%) and stir the slurry for 30 min. Then filter the reaction mixture through a plug of Hyflo Super Cel® (about ½" thick) and rinse 2 times with 1 volume of water. Filter this initial filtrate again through a Whatman® GF/F filter to collect small black particulates that escape through the first filtration. Acidify the filtrate slowly with 1 N HCl (1.5 equiv as compared to the LiOH added) {slow addition is very important for polymorph control-about 90 min. addition on 100 g scale}. Stir the milky suspension for 15 min. Filter the thick suspension through a glass frit to obtain a wet solid. Wash this wet solid 4 times with 5 volumes of water (breaking vacuum and stirring the solids with the water each time). Place the wet solid in a vacuum oven at 40 °C overnight (~15 h) to provide the title compound (92.2% yield).

The resulting slightly opaque solution was seeded once more (70 mg) and left for one hour at 40°C with stirring to allow for crystallization to start. After this, a total of 352 mL of ethyl acetate was added at a constant rate over one hour. When all of the ethyl acetate had been added, the slurry was left for 1 hour, before being cooled to 21°C over 2 hours.
