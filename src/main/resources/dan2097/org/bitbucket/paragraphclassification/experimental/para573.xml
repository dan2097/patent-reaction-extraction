<p id="p0064" num="0064" sourceFile="EP 1841834B1.xml">In a 100 ml 3-necked-flask equipped with a reflux condenser iridum(III)chloride hydrate (201.2 mg, 0.67 mmol, 1 eq.) is partially solved in 25 ml of a 3:1 mixture of 2-ethoxyethanol and water (degassed with N
  <sub>2</sub>) giving an olive-green solution and a brown-black insoluble solid. 2-Phenylpyridine (0.4 ml, 2.80 mmol, 4.2 eq.) is then added and the reaction mixture heated to 120 °C; the insoluble solid dissolves and an orange-yellow precipitate appears. After stirring over night at 120°C and cooling at room temperature the yellow product is filtered off, washed with ethanol and acetone and dried 
  <i>in vacuo</i> giving a yellow powder. Yield: 265.5 mg (0.25 mmol, 73 %), yellow powder.
