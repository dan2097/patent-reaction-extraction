    <li>The treatment and/or prophylaxis of thrombosis and hypercoagulability in blood and/or tissues of animals including man. It is known that hypercoagulability may lead to thrombo-embolic diseases. Conditions associated with hypercoagulability and thrombo-embolic diseases which may be mentioned include inherited or acquired activated protein C resistance, such as the factor V-mutation (factor V Leiden), and inherited or acquired deficiencies in antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, heparin cofactor II. Other conditions known to be associated with hypercoagulability and thrombo-embolic disease include circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (Lupus anticoagulant), homocysteinemi, heparin induced thrombocytopenia and defects in fibrinolysis, as well as coagulation syndromes (e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)) and vascular injury in general (e.g. due to surgery).</li>
