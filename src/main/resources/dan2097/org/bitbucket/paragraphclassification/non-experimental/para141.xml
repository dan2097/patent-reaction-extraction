<p id="p0038" num="0038" sourceFile="EPÂ 1667678B1.xml">It may be apparent now for the skilled person that the dose of a derivative of free IAA in the animal feed is to be adjusted in order to yield free IAA concentrations in the animal body that correspond to the ranges given herein for free IAA. This has to account for conversions that are mostly not entirely complete and
  <!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> losses during production when prepared chemically. Concentrations of derivatives may therefore best be established empirically, the experimental set-up as outlined in example 7 may be helpful in this respect. Consequently, when it is referred herein to a certain concentration of free IAA or a derivative thereof, it is meant that this is the concentration of free IAA or the concentration of the derivative that yields this particular concentration of free IAA in the animal. The skilled person will be aware of this and knows how to determine the proper concentrations of derivatives with the help of the teachings as provided herein.
