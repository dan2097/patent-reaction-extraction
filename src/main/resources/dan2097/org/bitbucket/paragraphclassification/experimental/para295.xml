<p id="p0722" num="0722" sourceFile="EP 1828185B1.xml">The title compound was prepared by treating 2,6-difluoro-
  <i>N</i>-(3-{3-[2-({7-[(trifluoroacetyl)amino]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl}amino)-4-pyrimidinyl]pyrazolo[1,5-
  <i>a</i>]pyridin-2-yl}phenyl)benzamide (161 mg, 0.24 mmol) with excess LiOH (200 mg) in MeOH. After stirring for 15 h at rt, the reaction was concentrated. The crude was partitioned between CHCl
  <sub>3</sub> and saturated aqueous NaHCO
  <sub>3</sub>. The organic was washed with brine, dried over Na
  <sub>2</sub>SO
  <sub>4</sub> and concentrated to a brown powder. Yield: 97 mg (70%).
