<p id="p0133" num="0133" sourceFile="EP 1828199B1.xml">To a stirred solution of 6.28 g (0.095 mol) malonitrile in 100 ml ethanol was added 8.00 g (0.095 mol) cyclopentanone, 3.04 g (0.095 mol) sulfur, and 8.29 ml (0.095 mol) morpholine. The mixture was heated at 80 °C for 2 h and then poured onto water and extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated 
  <i>in vacuo</i>. Flash chromatography (heptane / ethyl acetate 3:1) afforded 4.89 g (31%) 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophene-3-carbonitrile as a light brown solid. ES-MS m/e (%): 165 (M+H
  <sup>+</sup>, 100).
