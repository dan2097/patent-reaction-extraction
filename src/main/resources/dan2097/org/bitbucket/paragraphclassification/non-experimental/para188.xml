<p id="p0011" num="0011" sourceFile="EPÂ 1240130B1.xml">At least one metal catalyst is used in the present invention. The at least one metal catalyst comprises a metal compound with a metal selected from the group consisting of cobalt, manganese, vanadium, copper, molybdenum, and iron, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, a metal compound is a salt of the metal and more preferably an acetate or acetylacetonate of the metal. Illustrative metal compounds which are suitable for use in the invention include cobalt (II) acetate, manganese (II) acetate, vanadyl (IV) acetate (VO[OC(O)CH
  <sub>3</sub>]
  <sub>2</sub>), vanadyl (IV) acetylacetonate, copper
  <!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> (I) acetate, molybdenyl (VI) acetylacetonate (MoO
  <sub>2</sub>[C
  <sub>5</sub>H
  <sub>7</sub>O2]), iron (II) acetate, and mixtures thereof. The molar ratio of halo-ortho-xylene substrate to the at least one metal catalyst is in a range of about 20-500 : 1, preferably in a range of about 50-250 : 1, and most preferably in a range of about 80-180 : 1. In especially preferred embodiments the molar ratio of halo-ortho-xylene substrate to the at least one metal catalyst is about 100:1. The at least one metal catalyst may be added in one portion to the substrate or in more than one portion during the course of the reaction.
