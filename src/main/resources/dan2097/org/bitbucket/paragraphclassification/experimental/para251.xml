<p id="p0547" num="0547" sourceFile="EP 1828185B1.xml">2-Chloroethyl 3-nitrophenyl ether was dissolved in 90 mL EtOAc. A portion of Pt w/sulfide (2.04g, 0.524 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was then purged with H
  <sub>2</sub> and stirred at rt under 1 atm of H
  <sub>2</sub> overnight. The reaction was filtered through a celite plug and reduced under vacuo to attend 3.4 g (95% yield) of a colorless oil as the desired product.
