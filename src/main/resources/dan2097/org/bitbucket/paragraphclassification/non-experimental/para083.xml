Examples of "alkylene" as used herein include, but are not limited to, methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, and isobutylene. "Alkyl" also includes substituted alkyl. The alkyl (and alkylene) groups may be optionally substituted one or more times with a halogen or hydroxyl. Thus, the term "alkyl" includes for example, trifluoromethyl and trifluoroethyl, among other halogenated alkyls, and hydroxymethyl and other hydroxylated alkyls.
