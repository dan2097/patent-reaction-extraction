<p id="p0077" num="0077" sourceFile="EP 1533324B1.xml">19.14 mL of a 1.6 M solution of MeLi in diethylether (30.63 mmol) were added dropwise at 0°C to a solution of 2.76 g of 6-[dimethylsilyl(
  <i>tert</i>-butylamino)]N-methyl-2-methyl-5,6-dihydroindeno[2,1-b]indole (Mw=362.60, 7.62 mmol), obtained as reported above, in 40 mL of Et
  <sub>2</sub>O. The resulting dark brown solution was allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirred for 1.5 hours. Then 0.84 mL of TiCl
  <sub>4</sub> (Mw 189.71, d=1.730, 7.63 mmol) in 4 mL of pentane were slowly added at room temperature and the resulting black suspension stirred for 1.5 hours. The solvents were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was extracted with 50 mL of toluene. The extract (3.07 g) was added of 70 mL of pentane, the resulting dark brown suspension stirred for 30 min at room temperature and filtered, giving as residue a light brown powder, which was dried and analysed by 
  <sup>1</sup>H-NMR. The 
  <sup>1</sup>H-NMR analysis showed a purity of 97.0% wt. in the desired catalyst together with a 3.0% wt. of starting ligand. Yield = 64.4% (2.22g).
