In this way, the composition can be subdivided readily into smaller doses at the physicians direction. For example, unit dosages may be made up in packeted powders, vials or ampoules and preferably in capsule or tablet form. The active compound present in these unit dosage forms of the composition may be present in an amount of from about one gram to about fifteen grams or more, for single or multiple daily administration, according to the particular need of the patient. The daily dose of active compound will vary depending upon the route of administration, the size, age and sex of the patient, the severity of the disease state, and the response to the therapy as traced by blood analysis and the patients recovery rate. By initiating the treatment regimen with a minimal daily dose of about one gram, the blood levels of PAI-1 and the patients symptomatic relief analysis may be used to determine whether a larger dose is indicated. Based upon the data presented below, the projected daily dose for both human and veterinary use will be from about 25 to about 200 milligrams/kilogram per day, and more usually, from about 50 to about 100 milligrams/kilogram per day.</p>
