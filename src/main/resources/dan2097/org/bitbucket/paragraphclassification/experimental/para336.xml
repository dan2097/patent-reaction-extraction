<p id="p0741" num="0741" sourceFile="EP 1828185B1.xml">The title compound was synthesized by combining 
  <i>N</i>-{3-[3-(2-chloro-4-pyrimidinyl)pyrazolo[1,5-
  <i>a</i>]pyridin-2-yl]phenyl}-2,6-difluorobenzamide (200 mg, 0.43 mmol) (prepared according to a procedure similar to that described in 
  <b>Example 27,</b> Step C), 
  <i>N</i>-(5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1
  <i>H</i>-inden-2-yl)-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide (127 mg, 0.52 mmol), hydrochloric acid (0.043 mmol, 43 µL 1 M HCl/diethylether) and 2 mL isopropanol in a sealed vessel. The vial and contents were heated in a microwave synthesizer at 180 °C for 30 min. The reaction was cooled and concentrated. The residue was partitioned between EtOAc and saturated NaHCO
  <sub>3</sub>. The organic was
  <!-- EPO <DP n="192"> --> washed with brine, dried with MgSO
  <sub>4</sub> and concentrated. The crude material was purified by silica gel column chromatography (0 - 100% gradient; (90% DCM:9% MeOH:1 % NH
  <sub>4</sub>OH/DCM)). Purification provided 278 mg (95%) of the coupled adduct. ESIMS (M+H)+ = 684.20.
