<p id="p0339" num="0339" sourceFile="EP 1798223A2.xml">To a magnetically stirred mixture of precursor aminoketone (2.32 g, 10.0 mmol) in dry pyridine (20 mL) was added a solution of pipsyl chloride (4.78 g, 15.8 mmol) in toluene (20 mL) under dry nitrogen. The addition was performed over a 2h period. The reaction was stirred overnight
  <!-- EPO <DP n="101"> --> at 50°C, then additional pipsyl chloride (850 mg), as a solution in toluene, was added. After 6h, the reaction was concentrated and the residue was taken up in ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, then the mixture was filtered. The layers were separated and the organic layer was dried (MgSO
  <sub>4</sub>), filtered and concentrated to provide crystalline material.
