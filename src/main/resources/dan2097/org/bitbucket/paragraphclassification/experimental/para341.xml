  <i>H</i>-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (1.0 g, 3.1 mmol, prepared in example E-157) in THF to oxalyl chloride (0.29 mL, 3.3 mmol) in THF followed by 1 drop of DMF and stir at room temperature. After 2 hours, concentrate to a residue. Next, add the residue to N,O-dimethylhydroxyamine hydrochloride (0.32 g, 3.3 mmol) and pyridine (0.75 mL, 9.3 mmol) in methylene chloride with stirring. After 2 hours, pour the reaction mixture into water and extract with methylene chloride. Combine the organic extracts, wash with water and brine, dry over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filter, and concentrate under reduced pressure. Purify the residue by flash chromatography eluting with ethyl acetate:hexanes to provide the title compound. Mass spectrum (m/e): 370.1 (M+1).
