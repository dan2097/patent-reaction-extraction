  <i>N</i>-{3-[3-(2-chloro-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-fluoropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl]phenyl}-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide obtained 
  <b>Example 168,</b> Step B using a protocol similar to that described in 
  <b>Example 168</b>, Step C) in THF (10 mL) was added 2,6-difluorobenzoyl chloride (0.19 g). The reaction was kept stirring at rt for 0.5 h and worked up with sat. NaHCO
  <sub>3</sub> solution (8 mL). After extraction with EtOAc (2 X 10 mL), drying with Na
  <sub>2</sub>SO
