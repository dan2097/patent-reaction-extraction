<p id="p0160" num="0160" sourceFile="EP 1798223A2.xml">A solution of 3-methyl pyridine-1-oxide (10 g, 0.092 mol) in methyl iodide (15 ml) was left at rt for 18 hr and the solid was filtered. The filtrate was diluted with diethyl ether and extracted with water (40 ml). The solid was re-dissolved in the aqueous extract, 1,4-dioxane (50 ml) was added, followed by potassium cyanide (15 g, 0.23 mol) and the mixture was stirred at RT for 3 hr. The product was extracted with chloroform. The chloroform layer was washed with water, brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed 
  <i>in vacuo</i> and the crude product was purified by fractional distillation (61-62°C/0.2 mm) to yield a white low melting solid.
