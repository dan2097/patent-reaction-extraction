  <i>N</i>-{3-[(2-chlorol-4-pyrimidinyl)ethynyl]phenyl}-1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide (3.31 g, 9.8 mmol) in DMSO (75 mL) at rt was added 1-amino-pyridinium iodide (2.45 g, 11 mmol), followed by KOH (1.03 g, 18.4 mmol) and K
  <sub>2</sub>CO
  <sub>3</sub> (1.24 g, 9.2 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 2 h and then additional 1-amino-pyridinium iodide (0.33 g, 1.5 mmol) was added. Stirring was continued for 16 h and the DMSO was evaporated off by rotary evaporation and the dark crude partitioned between EtOAc and water. The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc twice and combined organics were dried over MgSO
  <sub>4</sub>, filtered, and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation to yield a tan solid. Purified by crystallization from MeOH to give the desired intermediate (1.6 g, 38%) as an off-white solid.
