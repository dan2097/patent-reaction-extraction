<p id="p0420" num="0420" sourceFile="EP 1326865B1.xml">A mixture of 8-hydroxyquinoline-7-carboxylic acid (0.50 g, 2.64 mmol), benzylamine (0.34 g, 3.17 mmol), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (0.45 g, 2.91 mmol), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (0.56 g, 2.91 mmol), and triethylamine (1.6 mL, 11.6 mmol) in DMF (15 mL) was heated at 80 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in methanol and subjected to HPLC purification on C-18 stationary phase eluted with water/acetonitrile/TFA mobile phase. Collection and lyophilization of appropriate fractions provide the title compound as yellow solid.
