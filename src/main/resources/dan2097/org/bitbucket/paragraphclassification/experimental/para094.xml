<p id="p0491" num="0491" sourceFile="EP 1326865B1.xml">To a solution of N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-8-hydroxy-5-(methylamino)-1,6-naphthyridine-7-carboxamide (5.75g, 17.6 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (60 mL) was added acetic anhydride (60mL) and the mixture stirred at 55C for 16hr. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the solids were collected by filtration and washed with EtOAc (50 mL) and dried in vacuo. The solids were recrystallized from acetonitrile to afford the title compound as a white crystalline solid.
