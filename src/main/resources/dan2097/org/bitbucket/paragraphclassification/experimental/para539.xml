<p id="p0594" num="0594" sourceFile="EP 1828185B1.xml">A solution of 1-amino-4-({[(1,1-dimethylethyl)(dimethyl)silyl]oxy}methyl)pyridinium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (15.7 mmol; crude) and 2-(methylthio)-4-[(3-nitrophenyl)ethynyl]pyrimidine (2.84g, 10.5mmol) in dry DMF (70 mL) was cooled to 0 °C. DBU (3.14 mL, 21.0 mmol) was added dropwise. Following complete addition, the mixture was stirred at rt for overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic phase was combined, washed with
  <!-- EPO <DP n="157"> --> brine, and dried (MgSO
  <sub>4</sub>). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. Chromatography on silica gel eluting with Hexane/ EtOAc gradient (10-50% EtOAc) gave yellow solid (750 mg).
