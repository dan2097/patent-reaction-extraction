  <sub>2</sub> was added 2,4-dichloro-5-fluoropyrimidine (1.66 g, 10 mmol), anhydrous, degassed THF (100 mL), dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) (180 mg, 0.26 mmol), copper(I) iodide (29 mg, 0.15 mmol), and TEA (2.02 g, 20 mmol). After heating the reaction at 60°C for 30 min, 1-bromo-3-ethynylbenzene (0.9 g, 5.0 mmol) was added dropwise as a solution in THF (25 mL) and the resulting mixture was allowed to heat overnight. The crude reaction mixture was adsorbed to silica gel and purified by column chromatography (2-10% EtOAc in hexanes) to afford the desired product (1.25 g, 78%) as an off white solid. ESIMS (M+H)+ = 311.
