  <sub>2</sub> x 2H
  <sub>2</sub>O (11.68 g, 0.051 mol) and the resulting mixture was allowed to stir overnight at rt. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, residue suspended in EtOAc (100 mL), washed with 1 M NaOH (100 mL), and filtered through a celite pad. The organic layer was removed, concentrated by rotary evaporation, and dried under high vacuum. The resulting residue was then dissolved in DCM (150 mL) followed by the addition of TEA (5.19 g, 0.051 mol) and trifluoroacetic anhydride (4.52 g, 0.022 mol). After overnight stirring, the reaction was washed with 1 M HCl (50 mL), organic layer concentrated and purified by column chromatography ( 1-10% gradient of EtOAc in hexanes) to yield the title compound (1.53 g, 60%) as a white solid. ESIMS (M-H)- = 297.
