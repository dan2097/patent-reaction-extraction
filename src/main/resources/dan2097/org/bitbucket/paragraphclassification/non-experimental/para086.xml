<p id="p0073" num="0073" sourceFile="EPÂ 1828185B1.xml">The precise therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of formula (I) will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the age and weight of the subject being treated, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of the formulation, and the route of administration, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physcian or veternarian. Typically, the compound of formula (I) will be given for treatment in the range of 0.1 to 200 mg/kg body weight of recipient (mammal) per day and more usually in the range of 1 to 100 mg/kg body weight per day. Acceptable daily dosages, may be from about 0.1 to about 2000 mg/day, and preferably from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/day. Thus, for a 70kg adult human being treated for a condition mediated by at least one ErbB family kinase, the actual amount per day would usually be from 70 to 700 mg and this amount may be given in a single dose per day or more usually in a number (such as two, three, four, five or six) of sub-doses per day such that the total daily dose is the same. A therapeutically effective amount of a salt or solvate, may be determined as a proportion of the therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula (I) 
  <i>per se</i>. It is envisaged that similar dosages would be appropriate for treatment of the other conditions referred to above.
