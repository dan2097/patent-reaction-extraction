  </nplcit>; 1.45 g (10 mmol) 3-oxo-3-phenyl-propionitrile, 0.76 g (5.0 mmol) [1,4]dithiane-2,5-diol, 0.40 ml (10 mmol) diethyl-amine and 5 ml ethanol were charged in a sealed tube. The reaction mixture was heated at 50 °C for 6 h. The tube was then placed in a fridge (about 4°C) for the night, and the product was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to afford 0.42 g (23%) (2-amino-thiophen-3-yl)-phenyl-methanone as a light brown crystals. ES-MS m/e (%): 204 (M+ H+, 100).
