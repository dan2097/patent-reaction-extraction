<p id="p0077" num="0077" sourceFile="EPÂ 2055710A1.xml">In another cell of said vacuum vapor-deposit device, charged was 4,4'-N,N'-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP) as an electroluminescent host material, and an organic electroluminescent compound (Compound 10) according to the present invention was charged to still another cell. The two materials were evaporated at different rates to carry out doping to vapor-deposit an electroluminescent layer (5) having 30 nm of thickness on the hole transport layer. The suitable doping concentration is 4 to 10 mol% on the basis of CBP.
