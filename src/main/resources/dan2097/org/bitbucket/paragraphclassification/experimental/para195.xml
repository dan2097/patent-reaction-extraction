  <!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> hydride (55 to 65% in oil) is added and the mixture stirred for 45minutes at room temperature. After cooling again to 0° a solution of 56mg (0.6mmol) methyl chloroformate in 0.5ml tetrahydrofuran is slowly added with a seringe. The yellowish solution is stirred at room temperature for 2h, treated with about 40ml of water, acidified to pH = 3 by addition of citric acid and extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo yielding 212mg of a yellow gum. Chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate / cyclohexane 1:1) gives 62mg (35%) of a slightly yellow solid. MS: m/e = 376.3 (M
