  <sub>2</sub>Cl (25.53 mmol) in Et
  <sub>2</sub>O were added at 0°C to a solution of 
  <i>
    <sup>t</sup>
  </i>BuNH
  <sub>2</sub> (56.16 mmol) to give a yellow slurry. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure, and the product extracted with toluene to give, after filtration and evaporation of the solvent, 5.52 g of an orange oil. 
  <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis shows the presence of the two isomers (allilic, 60 %, vinylic, 40 %). Yield 83.4 %.
