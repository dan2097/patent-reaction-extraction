  <figref idref="f0002">FIG. 2A</figref> is a graph illustrating LCMS results of a compound prepared according to Example 3. In addition, thermal analysis of the compound of Formula 11 was performed using a thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) in a N
  <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at a temperature in the range of room temperature to 600°C at 10°C/min in a Pt pan in a disposable Al pan and a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a temperature in the range of room temperature to 400°C in a disposable Al pan. As a result, Td was 467°C and Tg was 163°C.
