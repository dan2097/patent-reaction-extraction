<p id="p0052" num="0052" sourceFile="EP 1704154B1.xml">A stirred solution of 1-Benzenesulfonyl-3-(1-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl)-1H-indole (0.286 moles) was taken in a 100 mL 3 necked round bottomed flask, along with N,N-dimethyl acetamide (40 mL), potassium acetate (0.286 moles, 0.281 g) and dichloro bis(tri-o-tolylphosphine)palladium (0.0143 moles, 0.0126 g). The reaction mixture was
  <!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> maintained under nitrogen atmosphere and was heated to 160 °C with stirring for 16 hrs. After the completion of reaction, excess of dimethyl acetamide was distilled off under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 20 % methanol in ethyl acetate as an eluent. The final desired compound of general formula (I) could be further purified by preparation of their acid addition salts. IR spectra (cm-1): 2940.65, 1325.79, 1181.79, 583.29; Mass (m/z): 339 (M+H)
