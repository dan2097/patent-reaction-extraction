<p id="p0160" num="0160" sourceFile="EP 2055726A1.xml">In a 300 ml egg plant type flask, 20 g (222 mmol) of butanediol (available from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 58.7 g (488 mmol) of 3-mercaptobutanoic acid (available from Yodo Chemical Co., Ltd.), 2.78 g (14.6 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (available from Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.) and 100 g of toluene (available from Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.) were placed, and a Dean-Stark device and a cooling tube were installed. The contents in the flask were heated at an oil bath temperature of 140°C with stirring. After 4 hours from the initiation of reaction, the reaction solution was allowed to cool, washed with ion-exchanged water and then neutralized with a saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate aqueous solution. The resulting solution was further washed with ion-exchanged water three times and then subjected to dehydration-drying using anhydrous magnesium sulfate (available from Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.). Next, toluene was distilled off, and the remainder was subjected to column chromatography by a silica gel to perform purification of BDMB. As the silica gel, Wako gel C-200 (available from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was used, and as the elution solvent, n-hexane/acetone (7/1 by volume) was used. The BDMB obtained by purification was a colorless transparent liquid, and the yield was 31.1 g (48%).
