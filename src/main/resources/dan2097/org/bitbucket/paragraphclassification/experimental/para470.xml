The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite, and then the filtrate was washed with
  <!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> chloroform and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was added with chloroform (200 mL) and manganese dioxide (20 g, 230 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 55°C for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite, and washed with chloroform, and then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain 2-[3-(N-cyclopentylmethyl-N-ethyl)amino-6-methoxypyridine]carboxyaldehyde (1.68 g, 85%) as pale yellow oil.
