When acrylic acid is filtered prior to a step of purification at the time of supply to a storage tank, the generation of polymerized substances can be prevented in the storage tank, thereby, for example, the frequency of changing filters used in filtration prior to the step of purification can be reduced. Further, the amount of polymerized substances mixed in the step of purification can be reduced, thereby the production efficiency is improved. Moreover, when acrylic acid after the step of purification is filtered at the time of supply to a storage tank, acrylic acid to be the final product can be stably stored for a long period of time. Thus, acrylic acid that rarely tends to decrease in purity and thus acrylic acid with high stability can be provided as a product by the present invention.</p>
