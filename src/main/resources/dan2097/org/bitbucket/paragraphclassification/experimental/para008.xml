  <i>n</i>-BuLi 2.5 M in hexane (16.65 mmol) were added dropwise at 0°C to a solution of 3.53 g of N-methyl-2-methyl-5,6-dihydroindeno[2,1-b]indole (Mw = 233.32, purity 99.0%, 15.13 mmol) in Et
  <sub>2</sub>O. At the end of the addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirred for two hours. Subsequently, 3.34 g of 
  <i>(tert</i>-butylamino)dimethylchlorosilane (Mw = 165.74, purity 75.0% mol., d = 0.887, 20.17 mmol) were added at 0°C to the Li salt suspension and the resulting mixture was allowed to
  <!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> warm up to room temperature. After three hours stirring, the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in 50 mL of toluene, obtaining a dark brown suspension, which was filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, obtaining 5.86 g of a dark brown oil, which resulted to be 86.5% wt. pure (calculated by 
  <sup>1</sup>H-NMR). Yield = 92.4%.
